An example video of this application built and running on device can be found on my [YouTube Channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjgsJBXmN7ZedXu7ZuJCKsA/videos?view_as=subscriber "YouTube")

<br /> A first attempt to design and build an application using Unitys ARKit for iOS. The tracking is really great and able create tons of really fun game applications! 
<br /> This application is just a simple example of what can be done with this plguin. You really can create anything! I have just used a few scripts from one of my previous games combined with heart objects I designed recently in Blender. I was hoping to expand the application more, but I decided I came up with another idea to design an entirely new app with the ARKit. This will remain just a simple application that can be built easily to iOS.
